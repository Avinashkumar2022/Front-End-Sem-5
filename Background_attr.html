            I have been climbing the ladders of corporate world for the last few years and in all those years there is one thing for certain that I can say about this experience that it is not fun. I have grown old and resentful, I have acquired a great sum of money but now that I look back at the empire I have constructed, I feel nothing other than regret, regret of leaving the poeple I loved behind, regret of not going to movies with my friend when he asked me, regret of not spending more time with her when she wanted me to. 
            When people look at me, all they see is a man who has acquired everything there is to acquire. All they can see is what they want to see, what they think a person of my stature will be like but for all the wealth I have, I don't have the slightest of happiness to show for it.
